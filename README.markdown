Named Entity Recognition with Small Strongly Labeled and Large Weakly
Labeled Data

We provide a three stage framework:

Stage I: Domain continual pre-training; Stage II: Noise-aware weakly
supervised pre-training; Stage III: Fine-tuning. In this code base, we
actually provide basic building blocks which allow arbitrary combination
of different stages. We also provide examples scripts for reproducing
our results in BioMedical NER.
